## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

One thing I learned from building this project is how to provide link content in anchor tags when using an icon. I found the [solution below on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16791791/anchor-element-found-with-a-valid-href-attribute-but-no-link-content-has-been-s#23936969) which provides content that screen readers can use.

```html
<a>
  <span class="sr-only">some text that relates to your link</span>
  <i class="icon"> </i>
</a>
```
